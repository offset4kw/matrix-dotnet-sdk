# Matrix .NET SDK [![#dotnet:half-shot.uk](https://img.shields.io/matrix/dotnet:half-shot.uk.svg?server_fqdn=matrix.half-shot.uk&label=%23dotnet:half-shot.uk&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#dotnet:half-shot.uk)

This project provides a SDK for interfacing with the Matrix Protocol.

It has support for a limited subset of the C2S and AS APIs presently. Support for new endpoints is easy to add,
so please ask if you want a endpoint to be added.

The SDK is built against `netstandard2.0`, and will work with .NET core projects.

## How to Use

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Half-Shot/matrix-dotnet-sdk.svg?branch=dotnet-core)](https://travis-ci.org/Half-Shot/matrix-dotnet-sdk)

A nuget exists for this project at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Half-Shot.Matrix

There is a very barebones client included with the SDK.

## Documentation

Documentation is covered for the Client (and *some* of the API), however no online resources exist yet.

## Reporting Issues

Please report bugs/features through the github issue tracker.
